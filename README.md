# Logging-Aggregation-System-ELKK

This project demonstrates how a logging aggregation system pipeline works in a distributed runtime environment and Logback configuration in the context of a Spring-boot application.
A logging aggregation system pipeline collects, processes, and stores logs from multiple services or nodes in a distributed environment. This system ensures efficient log management for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing system behavior.
In the context of a Spring Boot application, Logback serves as the default logging framework, offering flexible and efficient logging capabilities.
